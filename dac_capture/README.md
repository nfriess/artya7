# DAC Capture Device

This project implements a device that captures data that is sent to
a Analog Devices AD1862 DAC.  The data can be saved in a file using
a Raspberry PI and then analyzed to troubleshoot issues with the
audio player and verify that the data is being recieved at the DAC
correctly.
